<h3> Lectures  </h3>




<h4 style="margin-top: 30pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; " id="Heckman"> Jonathan J. Heckman: <span style="color: blue;">Top Down Approach to Symmetries in Quantum Field Theory and Gravity </span> </h4>

<p>
	<b>Abstract: </b> <br> 
	We give an overview of recent advances in understanding generalized symmetries in the context of quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The overarching theme is to use a top down approach based on the UV complete framework of string theory to construct and study novel examples of such structures, especially at strong coupling, and especially in systems that are eventually coupled to gravity. <br> <br>

	A rough outline for the lectures is as follows: <br>

	&emsp; 1)	Overall motivation / introduction to engineering QFTs via extra-dimensional geometry <br>
	&emsp; 2)	Top down approach to topological symmetry operators and heavy defects <br>
	&emsp; 3)	Symmetry Topological Field Theories and their top down generalizations <br>
	&emsp; 4)	On the fate of global symmetries in quantum gravity <br> <br>

	Bonus Lecture (part of 4, time permitting):  <br>
	&emsp; How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider <br>

<h4 style="margin-top: 50pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" id="Sorce"> Jonathan Sorce: <span style="color: blue;">Operators in quantum field theory</span> </h4>

<p>
	<b>Abstract: </b> <br> 
	These lectures will provide an introduction to the “algebraic approach” to quantum field theory. In this approach, one focuses on the way fields act on Hilbert space as operators, and studies the physics of quantum field theory using mathematical tools from functional analysis. I will present on the general mathematical structure, some concrete settings in which explicit calculations can be performed, and connections to an exciting modern topic of research in which operator algebras are used to study black hole entropy. <br> <br> 

	Lecture 1: Smeared fields and unbounded operators <br> 
	Lecture 2: von Neumann algebras and modular theory <br> 
	Lecture 3: Operators in free field theory <br> 
	Lecture 4: (Bonus, depending on time) Types, traces, and renormalization <br>

<h4 style="margin-top: 50pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" id="Murthy"> Sameer Murthy: <span style="color: blue;"> Black holes and their microstates in string theory </span></h4>

<p>
	<b>Abstract: </b> <br> 
	The broad goal of this lecture series is to describe the idea of the counting of supersymmetric black hole microstates in string theory. I will describe the main ideas that underlie this subject, from the original breakthroughs of Strominger-Vafa and Sen in the 1990s to more recent developments involving large quantum effects in near-extremal black holes.

<p>
	<b>Abstract: </b> <br> 
	In these lectures, I will review several distinct 2d string theories (broadly defined) and discuss how they serve as valuable theoretical laboratories for exploring fundamental aspects of string theory and quantum gravity. In particular, I will cover classic models such as the c=1 and type 0B string theories, as well as more recent developments, including the Virasoro minimal string and the complex Liouville string.

<h4 style="margin-top: 50pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" id="Montero"> Miguel Montero: <span style="color: blue;"> An Introduction to the Swampland Program </span> </h4>

<p>
	<b>Abstract: </b> <br> 
	At first sight, it might seem that any quantum field theory, regarded as a low-energy effectve field theory (EFT), can be coupled to Einsteinian gravity. Over the past few years, a large body of work has challenged this view, arguing that not every EFT arises as the IR of a consistent theory of quantum gravity. EFT’s that do not descend from quantum gravity are said to be in the “Swampland”. <br><br>

	This lectures will provide a bird’s eye view over some of the recent efforts in delineating the boundaries of the Swampland, collectively known as the “Swampland Program”. <br><br>

	We first give an introduction to the oldest Swampland Conjecture, the absence of global symmetries, but from a modern point of view of topological symmetry operators and its generalization to non-invertible symmetries. <br><br>

	We then introduce a certain extension of the absence of global symmetries, known as the Cobordism Conjecture, and discuss its applications to constrain the Landscape of minimal supergravity in more than six dimensions. <br><br>

	Finally, we will discuss other conjectured properties of quantum gravity which we cover in this chapter, including Weak Gravity Conjecture, its phenomenological implications, and the Distance Conjecture, ranging from recent connections to EFT strings to the Emergent String Conjecture and implications for potentials.

<h4 style="margin-top: 50pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" id="Kazakov"> Vladimir Kazakov: <span style="color: blue;"> Integrability of AdS5/CFT4, Quantum Spectral Curve and Fishnet CFT </span> </h4>

<p>
	<b>Abstract: </b> <br> 
	The lectures are aimed at the description and some practical applications of integrability of the spectrum of conformal operators in N=4 super-Yang Mills theory in the ‘t Hooft limit. <br> <br> 

	After an introduction into the basics of the subject: AdS/CFT correspondence, Large N limit, (super)conformal symmetry, definition of conformal operators, I will present the one-loop computation of the dilatation operator and explain how to diagonalize it and thus extract the spectrum of anomalous dimensions, using the algebraic Bethe ansatz. <br> <br> 

	Then I will define the system of Baxter Q-functions, their analyticity properties and the so called QQ-relations among these functions, encoded into the Hasse diagram. This will allow to introduce the AdS5/CFT4 Q-system solving the problem of spectrum of conformal dimensions of a-priori any conformal operator in the planar limit. Example of operators in SL(2) sector of the theory will be considered. <br> <br> 

	If the time permits, I will present the so-called fishnet limit of gamma-twisted version of N=4 SYM, combining the double scaling limit of large twist and the weak coupling. Integrability of the resulting fishnet CFT and its generalizations allows  computations of a large class of multi-loop Feynman graphs.
